<p>i really like poems, mostly because my mum read like a billion to me as a kid. shes a big nerd.</p>

<p>my favourite types of poems are ones that are easy to understand and blank verse. more like stories, maybe?</p>

<p>i think it's pretty stupid how some poems make themselves confusing on purpose. and then people pretend to understand them??</p>

<p>i was on reddit and i saw this poem that was like:</p>
<p>winter is long</p>
<p>spring is short</p>
<p>fall is empty</p>
<p>summer is when"</p>
<p>or something along those lin.es. it genuinely ended with "summer is when" ??!? WHAT</p>
